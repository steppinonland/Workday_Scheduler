# Workday_Scheduler
Homework #5

Description:
This is a workday planner that is set up to log an activity for every hour of a workday. You can save an activity by typing one into the box, then hitting 'save'. Your information will save even after refreshing the page.

Concepts used in this project:
In this assignment, I used the local storage and jQuery concepts. I also utilized a 'for' loop to assign the classes to the times based on the current hour. I also used moment.js, which I haven't used before.

Most of the CSS and HTML were written out for me, so all I needed to do was code the Javascript. I was glad that I grasped this material so well. The last homework was very difficult for me. Now, I'm glad I can more easily organize and execute a project's various tasks.
